        The CNN Academy Newsroom Simulation is a competitive challenge to
        investigate and report on a fictional breaking news story and has been
        designed in consultation with CNN journalists from around the world that
        puts journalism skills to the test in a realistic setting.

      <p className="paragraph">
        Each element of the scenario has been specifically tailored to reinforce
        journalistic best practices in conjunction with the broader CNN Academy
        curriculum. As part of the simulation, participants will produce video
        reports that will be judged by a panel of experienced CNN staff.
